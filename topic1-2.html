                    Jeff Raskin was a human computer interaction expert who worked for Apple and has been attributed
                    with the conception of the original Macintosh computer. In 1967 he graduated from Pennsylvania State
                    University with a degree in computer science. Jeff passed away in 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raskin developed his own programming language called FLOW while working as an assistant professor at
                    the University of California. The language only had several statements and could not interact with
                    numbers. FLOW was primarily used to teach programming to non-technical students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jeff started working for Apple in the very early days of the company. He began his work by creating
                    BASIC programming manuals. In 1978 computers were not as widespread and ubiquitous as they are
                    today. He saw the a future where personal computers were everywhere and would be able to do so much
                    more. Jeff is best known for his contributions to the early development of the Macintosh. The
                    Macintosh was designed to be a low
                    cost, highly functional and easily accessible computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After leaving Apple in 1982 he created the company Information Appliance, Inc which was responsible
                    for creation of the Canon CAT. The CAT is often referred to as the spiritual heir of the original
                    Macintosh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2000 Jeff published his book The Human Interface, which contains suggestions for human computer
                    interface design. The book also contains some interesting rules that he recommends when designing
                    interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jeff spent over 30 years building a new human computer interface called The Human Environment, which
                    he later renamed to Archy. His son Aza Raskin has continued the work on Archy after Jeffs passing.
