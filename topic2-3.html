                    The iPad is my favorite non-traditional computing device. Itâ€™s hard to believe that the iPad is 10 years old now. The first-generation of iPads were released in April of 2010 and I purchased my first iPad later that year. iPads and other touch devices like cell phones have become so common these days that they may not even be considered non-traditional devices at this point, however, I will leave that decision to greater minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not going to talk about the first iPad though. I am going to discuss the iPad Pro 4th generation released earlier this year. But first I am going to cover some commonalities that all iPads and other tablets or touch devices have in common. Generally speaking, tablets and other modern touch devices have a capacitive screen, which utilizes the users own conductivity to register minute changes in the electrostatic field. The screen is embedded with tiny metal strings which are laid out in an overlapping grid pattern. Most modern tablets have built in Wi-Fi connectivity, and some higher-end models even have cellular connectivity. Most peripherals like keyboards and mice have to be wirelessly connected via Bluetooth, unless the device has USB ports. Lack of ports and having to buy additional dongles to support peripherals is one of the biggest drawbacks to using tablets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These touch screen devices are quite limited in their extensibility, repairability and configurability, and are quite limited with what can be installed on them. Apple often has even less input and output options than other brands. This lack of ports is for the most part intentional and is used to steer customers into purchasing expensive wireless peripherals. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The iPad Pro 4th generation comes with the newest iteration in Apple silicon, the A12Z Bionic system on a chip (SoC). The A12Z Bionic is an ARM processer with 8 cores and a clock rate of 2490 MHz.<sup>1</sup> It also has 6GB of RAM, and an 8-core GPU. The hardware in this tablet puts it on par with some laptops and even some lower end desktops. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has a laundry list of new features such as a LiDAR scanner, multiple cameras with varying angles, a motion co-processor and a neural engine, just to name a few.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The newest iPad paired with the sold separately keyboard is beginning to blur the lines between tablets and traditional laptops.
