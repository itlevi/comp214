                    I went off on a bit of a tangent while researching 3D printing for this assignment’s topic, which
                    ended up with me almost purchasing a $2000 3D printer. I believe the purchase is inevitable, but I
                    plan to do quite a bit more research before making my decision on which printer to buy. If I didn’t
                    work full-time, go to school full-time and have 3 kids I probably would have bought one already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3D printing is the process of outputting physical objects from computer generated 3D models. The
                    most common and accessible method is using heated filament to build the 3D object up layer by layer.
                    3D printing has been used extensively in creating rapid prototypes in a wide spectrum of industries,
                    which on a small scale has a huge cost savings over traditional injection mold methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first heard about 3D printing in 2009 when I was in College for Multimedia Production. It was such
                    a wild concept to me at the time. My professor at the time was talking to us about the RepRap
                    project, an open source 3D printer which could print the majority of its own pieces and
                    self-replicate. The biggest hurdle for the average person to start 3D printing is the high up-front
                    cost of the machine and materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest ethical issue with 3D printing right now is piracy. Being able to download a companies
                    patented design and print a copy of that object for yourself has quite a few people concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3D printing has come a long way since 2009. There have been many advancements in the field, one of
                    which is being able to print simple human body parts like noses, ears and even skin. You can even 3D
                    print food now. 3D printing is truly one of the ultimate tools in human history, and the only limits
                    it has is our imaginations.
