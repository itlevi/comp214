        <p>
            This page was created for COMP 214 Topic 4.2 - Create a Web Interface for Course Topic Explorations. I added an iframe tag inside of the HTML
            which contains all of the depreciated frame and frameset code. I had to change the doctype to an HTML4 doctype which supported frameset to get the
            content to work.
        </p>
        <p>These are the assignment instructions:</p>
        <p>
            Create a five-page website with frames, including a permanent header (always displayed) navigation menu
            (always displayed) and a third frame into which the sub-pages load. Click here for Template for Frames
            Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main page should be a welcome page, containing information to the effect that the site contains your
            links to relevant sites on main topic areas of the course. Sub-pages should be dedicated to, and titled:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Design Principles for HCI
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Specialized Input Devices and Their Applications
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Specialized Output Devices and Their Applications
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Emerging Interface Concepts and Technologies
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each link page should include an appropriate illustration and at least two relevant links, located through
            your own searches. Each link should be accompanied by a brief description or summary of the site contents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use APA style to list and cite sources. Provide live links to all sources you list. When you have completed
            all of your Topic 4 activities, upload all of your files for Topic 4 to the Assignment 4 link. You can
            upload the HTML files or a document with your URL listed.
        </p>
